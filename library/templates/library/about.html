      <h1>About the Library of Digital Latin Texts</h1>

        <p>The LDLT aims to publish high-quality, critical editions of Latin texts from all eras. Editions are published as <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">TEI XML</a> files encoded according to our <a href="https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html">guidelines</a>. Those files are stored in a version-controlled repository, and they are openly available under a Creative Commons license.</p>

        <p>Central to our philosophy is the idea that interfaces are a form of scholarship entirely different from textual criticism. Textual scholars should not have to master the scholarly fields of human computer interaction and data visualization to publish a digital edition. Rather, the data for critical editions should be openly available for scholars in those fields to use in making arguments about the text from their perspective.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, so that users may read and interact with LDLT texts, we have made a standard interface available on this site. The interface is itself an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean">CETEIcean</a>, a research project of Hugh Cayless and Raffaele Viglianti. The interface provides a basic navigation menu; an interactive apparatus criticus that allows dynamic swapping of variant readings into and out of the main text; filters for types of variants; and dynamically generated lexical and morphological analysis, courtesy of the <a href="https://alpheios.net/">Alpheios project</a>.</p>

        <p>Scholars interested in submitting a proposal for an edition should contact the appropriate learned society for the era of the text. Each society has developed, or is developing, specific policies and procedures for reviewing submissions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://classicalstudies.org/publications-and-research/ldlt-scs-guidelines">SCS Procedures for Evaluation of Proposals and Submissions</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.medievalacademy.org/page/LDLTSubmissions">MAA Procedures for Evaluation of Proposals and Submissions</a></li>
          <li>RSA procedures (coming soon)</li>
        </ul>
