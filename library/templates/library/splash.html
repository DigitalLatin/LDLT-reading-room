        <p>The <em>Library of Digital Latin Texts</em> is published by the <a href="https://digitallatin.org">Digital Latin Library</a> (DLL) on behalf of the following learned societies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://classicalstudies.org">Society for Classical Studies</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.medievalacademy.org/">Medieval Academy of America</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.rsa.org/">Renaissance Society of America</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Under this partnership, the DLL maintains the platform, infrastructure, and <a href="https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/">encoding guidelines</a> for the series. The organizations listed above oversee the process of receiving proposals for new editions, submitting them for peer review, and making decisions regarding publication.</p>
        
        <p>The LDLT aims to publish high-quality, critical editions of Latin texts from all eras. Editions are published as <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">TEI XML</a> files encoded according to our <a href="https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html">guidelines</a>. Those files are stored in a version-controlled repository, and they are openly available under a Creative Commons license.</p> 
        
        <p>This website provides a standard interface for viewing published LDLT editions. The interface is itself an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean">CETEIcean</a>, a research project of Hugh Cayless and Raffaele Viglianti. The interface provides a basic navigation menu; an interactive apparatus criticus that allows dynamic swapping of variant readings into and out of the main text; filters for types of variants; and dynamically generated lexical and morphological analysis, courtesy of the <a href="https://alpheios.net/">Alpheios project</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Scholars interested in submitting a proposal for an edition should contact the appropriate learned society for the era of the text. Each society has developed, or is developing, specific policies and procedures for reviewing submissions:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://classicalstudies.org/publications-and-research/ldlt-scs-guidelines">SCS Procedures for Evaluation of Proposals and Submissions</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.medievalacademy.org/page/LDLTSubmissions">MAA Procedures for Evaluation of Proposals and Submissions</a></li>
          <li>RSA procedures (coming soon)</li>
        </ul>
